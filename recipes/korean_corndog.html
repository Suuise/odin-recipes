<ul style="font-family:Open Sans">1 tbsp garlic powder</ul> 
<ul style="font-family:Open Sans">1 tbsp onion powder</ul> 
<ul style="font-family:Open Sans">1 tbsp smoked parpika</ul>
<ul style="font-family:Open Sans">1 tbsp chipotle chile powder</ul>
<ul style="font-family:Open Sans">1 ½ tsp salt</ul>  
<ul style="font-family:Open Sans">1 cup hot sauce (Tabasco or Frank's)</ul> 
<ul style="font-family:Open Sans">8 chicken thighs or 4 lbs (with bone and skin on)</ul> 

<ul style="font-family:Open Sans"><Strong>Hotdog and Fries:</Strong></ul>

<ul style="font-family:Open Sans">5 ½ cups all-purpose flour, divided</ul> 
<ul style="font-family:Open Sans">4 tbsp cayenne pepper, divided</ul>
<ul style="font-family:Open Sans">4 tsp salt, divided</ul>
<ul style="font-family:Open Sans">2 tsp smoked paprika</ul>  
<ul style="font-family:Open Sans">2 tsp garlic powder</ul>  
<ul style="font-family:Open Sans">2 cup full-fat buttermilk</ul>  
<ul style="font-family:Open Sans">1 cup hotsauce (Tabasco or Frank's)</ul>  </ul>  
<ul style="font-family:Open Sans">Vegetable oil, for frying</ul>  

<ul style="font-family:Open Sans"><Strong>Optional Garnish:</Strong></ul>

<ul style="font-family:Open Sans">Traditionally dusted with sugar and drizzled with both ketchup and mustard. However, you may add whatever you enjoy!</ul>

<h3 style="font-family:Open Sans">Instructions</h3>


<ul style="font-family:Open Sans"><Strong>Making the dough:</Strong></ul>

<ol>Combine the warm water and sugar in a bowl. Stir well.</ol>
<ol>Add the active dry yeast and let it sit for a few minutes until the yeast melts.</ol>
<ol>Add the salt and flour. Mix well with a wooden spoon for about 2 minutes until it turns smooth without any lumps at all.</ol>
<ol>Cover and let it sit until the volume doubles in size, about 1 hour.</ol>

<ul style="font-family:Open Sans"><Strong>Potatos & skewers:</Strong></ul>

<ol>Boil a quart of water in a pan. Drain the potato and add it to the boiling water. Blanch for 2 minutes.</ol>
<ol>Drain the potato and rinse in cold running water to remove any excess starch.</ol>
<ol>Drain the potato and dry out out the pieces with a cotton cloth or paper towel.</ol>
<ol>Put the potato into a bowl and mix with 2 tablespoons flour. Set aside.</ol>
<ol>Skewer the hot dogs on skewers or wooden chopsticks.</ol>

<ul style="font-family:Open Sans"><Strong>Shaping and frying:</Strong></ul>

<ol>Heat 4 inches of oil in a large frying pan or wok to 320°F- 330°F. The pan should be deep and wide enough to immerse at least one hot dog plus the stick. If you don’t have kitchen thermometer, use a wooden chopstick to dip a bit of dough into the oil. If it bubbles vigorously, it’s ready to fry!</ol>
<ol>Place the diced potato on your cutting board next to your bread crumbs and your batter, all in a row. Coat a hot dog skewer with the batter, turning the skewer around so it’s fully covered. You can use your hands to shape it a bit, if you need to! Then roll it in the potato bits, and pack them into the batter a bit with your hands, until they stick. Then roll it in the breadcrumbs until it’s completely covered before dropping it into the hot oil.</ol>
<ol>Fry for 6 to 7 minutes. Repeat with all of your hot dog skewers.</ol>

<ul style="font-family:Open Sans"><Strong>Dust and garnish:</Strong></ul>

<ol>You can garnish as you like, but Korean street vendors lightly dust each hot dog in sugar, and then drizzle both ketchup and yellow mustard over top.</ol>
<ol>Serve and eat right away!</ol>
